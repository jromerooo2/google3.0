# How it works 🔍

Fetching Google api based on the input given by the user. Not all of the searchs are completely true
because of the Google api being paid. So I used dummy data to render fake news.


# Want a Demo 🕹️?
- Just generate your own Keys on Google's custom search API and Context Keys
- Create a .env file with those keys 
- npm i for the dependencies
- npm run dev, then check localhost:3000 for the result
